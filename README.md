# user-form-project

# Description

The project aims to create an interface where users can input their personal details, including their first name, last name, email, and a message. The project employs React for frontend development, Redux for centralized state management, and the Validator library to ensure the integrity of the data being collected. Once submitted, the data is stored in the Redux store and can be displayed back to the user, making it a foundational example of a data collection and display mechanism using modern web development tools.

## Installation & Local Setup

Before diving into the application, ensure you have `Node.js` and `npm` (Node Package Manager) installed on your computer. If not, download and install them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

**1. Clone the repository to your local machine:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DimaPolishuk1995/user-form-project.git
   ```

**2. Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd user-form-project
   ```

**3. Install the necessary dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

**4. Run the application in development mode:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   
   Runs the app in the development mode.\
   Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser.

   The page will reload when you make changes.\
   You may also see any lint errors in the console.
 
   ```

## Available Scripts

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
